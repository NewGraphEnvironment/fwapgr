An R ðŸ“¦ for retrieving data from the [B.C. Freshwater Atlas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/freshwater). `fwapgr` is an R client for [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg), a PostgreSQL database and [web API](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/). Data are provided as [simple features](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).  

Get and filter data from collections:  

* `fwa_collection()`  
* `fwa_stream_gnis()`  

List and search metadata:  

* `fwa_list_tables()`  
* `fwa_list_columns()`  
* `fwa_list_gnis_streams()`  
* `fwa_search_gnis_streams()`  

Perform spatial operations:  

* `fwa_nearest_stream()`  
* `fwa_watershed_at_measure()`  
* `fwa_stream_at_measure()`  
* `fwa_watershed_hex()`  


## Installation

To install the developmental version from [GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwapgr)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/fwapgr")
```

## Demonstration
```{r}
fwapgr::fwa_search_gnis_streams("yakoun")

yakoun <- fwapgr::fwa_collection("fwa_stream_networks_sp", filter = list(gnis_name = 'Yakoun River'))
yakoun[c("blue_line_key", "gnis_name", "length_metre")]
```

## Information

For more information see the [Get Started](https://poissonconsulting.github.io/fwapgr/articles/fwapgr.html) vignette.

## Credit and Inspiration
`fwapgr` is meant to succeed [fwabc](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwabc). `fwabc` retrieved data [via WFS](https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/wfs?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=WHSE_BASEMAPPING.FWA_LAKES_POLY&outputFormat=json&SRSNAME=epsg%3A3005&CQL_FILTER=GNIS_NAME_1=%27Quamichan%20Lake%27) with the [bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata) ðŸ“¦. Instead, `fwapgr` leverages the power of PostgreSQL and PostGIS via a database and [web API](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/) hosted and created by [Hillcrest Geographics](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/main/).

Many thanks to [Simon Norris](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) for his work on [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) and [the API](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/).

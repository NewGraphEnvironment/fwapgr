An R package ðŸ“¦ for retrieving data from the [B.C. Freshwater Atlas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/freshwater) using [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg). Data are provided as [simple features](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).  

- `fwa_()` - Get features from a layer.
- `fwa_gnis_()` - Get features by gnis_name.
- `fwa_list_()` - Get metadata.
- `fwa_search_()` - Search metadata with regular expression.

## Installation

To install the developmental version from [GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwapgr)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/fwapgr")
```

## Demonstration
```{r}
fwapgr::fwa_search_gnis_streams("yakoun")

yakoun <- fwapgr::fwa_feature("fwa_stream_networks_sp", 
                              filter = "gnis_name = 'Yakoun River'", 
                              columns = c("gnis_name"))
yakoun
```

## Credit and Inspiration
`fwapgr` is meant to succeed [fwabc](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwabc). `fwabc` is a wrapper on [bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata), which retrieves data [via WFS](https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/wfs?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=WHSE_BASEMAPPING.FWA_LAKES_POLY&outputFormat=json&SRSNAME=epsg%3A3005&CQL_FILTER=GNIS_NAME_1=%27Quamichan%20Lake%27). However, this approach did not work well for large requests. 

`fwapgr` instead retrieves data from a PostgreSQL database hosted by [Hillcrest Geographics](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/main/) (see [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg)) via [this API](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/fwa/).

Many thanks to [Simon Norris](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) for his work on [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) and [the API](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/fwa/).

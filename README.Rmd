An R package ðŸ“¦ for searching & retrieving data from the [B.C. Freshwater Atlas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/freshwater). Data are fetched from a PostgreSQL database via [this API](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/fwa/) hosted by [Hillcrest Geographics](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/main/). Data are provided as [simple features]()https://github.com/r-spatial/sf

- `fwa_()` - Get features from a layer.
- `fwa_gnis_()` - Convenience functions to get features by gnis_name.
- `fwa_list_()` - Get metadata.
- `fwa_search_()` - Search metadata with regular expression.

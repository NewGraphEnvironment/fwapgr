`fwapgr` is an R client for the [BC Freshwater Atlas PostgreSQL](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) database [web API](https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/index.html). It gets and filters data from the BC Freshwater Atlas into R!  

In this article, we will create a basic map of the Yakoun River watershed in Haida Gwaii, BC, primarily using `fwapgr`'s workhorse function: `fwa_collection`. We can get started by looking at all available tables and which columns are in a specific table.
```{r}
fwapgr::fwa_list_tables()
```

```{r}
fwapgr::fwa_list_columns('fwa_stream_networks_sp')
```

`fwa_collection` allows us to retrieve data from any available table in the database and filter for desired values on any column. To get a linestring feature of the Yakoun river, we could use the 'fwa_stream_networks_sp' or 'fwa_named_streams' table and filter by `gnis_name` column. 

```{r, results='hide'}
fwapgr::fwa_collection("fwa_stream_networks_sp", filter = list(gnis_name = "Yakoun River"))
```

Let's also get the Yakoun River watershed using the "fwa_named_watersheds_poly" table.
```{r}
wshed <- fwapgr::fwa_collection(table = "fwa_named_watersheds_poly", filter = list(gnis_name = "Yakoun River"))
```

Next, let's get all the lakes that are within the Yakoun river watershed. We can use the `bbox` argument for this and the 'fwa_lakes_poly' table. 
```{r}
bbox <- sf::st_bbox(wshed)
lakes <- fwapgr::fwa_collection("fwa_lakes_poly", bbox = bbox)
```

Finally, lets get all streams within the watershed bounds with stream_order greater than 1. order streams.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
streams <- fwapgr::fwa_collection("fwa_stream_networks_sp", bbox = bbox)
streams <- streams[streams$stream_order > 2,]
```

To make the map look a little prettier, we can clip the stream and lake layers to the watershed polygon.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
streams <- sf::st_intersection(streams, wshed)
lakes <- sf::st_intersection(lakes, wshed)
```
